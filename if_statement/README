	Retirement Calculator App
========================================

For this assignment, you will take from the user 
their current financial status as well as their
goal for retirement and see if they will hit
their goal.

You will use floats for everything, and will 
input from the user the following values:
1) Current retirement balance
2) Years to retirement
3) Monthly contribution
4) Average interest rate across entire investment.
For example, if this is 10, this means your entire
investment will be increased by 10% (x1.1) at the
end of the investment period.
5) Target/Goal - how much money you want to have when
you retire

After every value you input from the user, you
will use an if statement to vet their input
to make sure it is valid. If it is NOT valid
then you will print "BAD INPUT" to the screen
and do an exit(1) to quit.

The valid ranges for #1 through #4 above are:
1) 0 to 100,000,000,000 (100 billion dollars)
2) 0.082 (one month) to 60 (years)
3) 0 to 1,000,000 (1 million dollars)
4) 0 to 1,000 (100 = 100% interest, which means your
total investment will have doubled by the end of the
time period)
5) 0 to 1,000,000,000,000 (1 trillion dollars)

After you vet the input, you will do the calculations.

If the total amount of money they have at retirement
meets or exceeds the target, then print:
"Congrats, you will be fine when you retire.\n";
If they will not hit the target, then print:
"Sorry, but you will need to invest more into retirement.\n";
