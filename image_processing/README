====================================
 Image Processing Happy Fun Time #34
====================================

Introduction: This is an open-ended assignment in which you and your partner
will be able to exercise both your programming skills and artistic side.

I have given you operational code that will apply two image filters to an
image. You should compile it (using "make" instead of g++) and run it (a.out
chenonceau.jpg) to get a feel for how it works: it will output the following:
1) The time it took to load the image
2) The time it took to darken it by 50%
3) The time it took to sepia-tone it
4) The time it took to write the file to disk

The output file is called output.jpg (and isn't especially high quality).

You can use an scp client (like WinSCP if you are on windows) to transfer
files to and from your directory and test the code on any image you upload,
and then download output.jpg and view the result.

Your tasks:

1) First, you must think of some other sort of image filter you might want to
write, and then write it. Replace either the darken code or the sepia code
with your new filter. The cooler the filter, the more points you will get.

2) Second, do the same for the other filter.

3) Third, you must draw your logo somewhere on the screen as a watermark to
show who made the image. This can be as simple as doing a small red triangle in
the bottom left corner, or as complicated as a signature. It should overwrite
whatever image data was there before, and be visible to the naked eye.
Extra Credit: More compilicated logos can be worth more points

4) Finally, you must hide a secret message somewhere in the image, with a
hashtag prepending it. The message itself can be your choice, but should be
something like #free_harambe or anything of similar length. You can hide it
however you want, but the message must be recoverable by a third party
somehow.

Grading:
You will get one grade for each bullet point above, up to a maximum of a B.

In order to get an A, you must do something awesome on one of the bullet
points above. Doesn't matter which. Just be creative. If you're extra
awesome, you can get an A+, or an A++, etc.
